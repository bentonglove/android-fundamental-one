# Preface

The Android Fundamental Training Course is a hands-on introduction to designing and building mobile applications using the Android open source platform. Android Fundamental explains the philosophy of developing for Android through its main application development building blocks and their interaction with one another.

This completely hands-on course encourages students to learn by building increasingly more sophisticated and meaningful mobile applications for Android.

By the end of the course, each participant will build their own complete Android application incorporating most of the key aspects of the platform. Typically, we build a Twitter app for Android, but there are other choices depending on the interests of participants.
