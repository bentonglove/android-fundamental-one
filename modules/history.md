# History of Android

History of Android module focuses on how we got here. The goal of the module is to give us an idea of design philosophy behind Android, and what it may say about the future of the platform. At this high level, we explore both technical and business choices that effect the platform for a long time. We'll look at how and Android operating system gets put together by various parties involved, from Google to carriers. Topics in this module include:

## Vision for Android

Android is a comprehensive open source platform designed for primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Android first unveiled at 2007 at the same time Open Handset Alliance (a group of technology and mobile companies who have come together to accelerate innovation in mobile technology) is announced. Google, is primary maintainer for Android and controls Android development roadmap.

### Comprehensive

Android delivers a complete set of software for mobile devices: an operating system, middleware and key mobile applications.

Android provides all the tools and frameworks and SDK for developers to start creating Android apps. Android comes with key mobile applications (phone, messaging, camera, emails and others) for users to start using it. Android also enable manufacturers to bring life for their devices.

### Open Source

Android is an open source platform. The entire stack, from low-level Linux modules all the way to native libraries, and from the application framework to complete applications, is totally open. This version of Android called Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions. Manufacturers and developers are free to extend and incorporate new cutting edge technologies as they emerge.

### Designed for Mobile Devices

Android developed with consideration of mobile devices strengths and constraints. It uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard. Android also use custom virtual machines that considers limited battery life of a mobile devices. When an Android app is no longer in use, the system will automatically suspend it in memory.

## Android timeline

These are the key events of the past few years:

* In 2005, Google acquired Android Inc.
* In 2007, the Open Handset Alliance is announced. Android is officially open sourced.
* In 2008, the Android SDK 1.0 is released. The first commercially available smartphone running Android, the HTC Dream, is released.
* In 2010, Google launched its Nexus series.
* In 2011, Android has the largest installed base of any mobile OS.
* In 2013, Android devices also sell more than Windows, iOS and Mac OS devices combined.

### Android version history

The version history of the Android mobile operating system began with the release of the Android beta in November 2007. The first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released in September 2008. Android is under ongoing development by Google and the Open Handset Alliance (OHA), and has seen a number of updates to its base operating system since its initial release.

## Google Mobile Services

Google Mobile Services are the proprietary apps and services bundled with Android devices. While Android itself is an open source project, the finished product that ends up in users' hands has the additional embedded components collectively known as GMS. This includes Google Play Services as well as other Google branded apps like Gmail and Maps. 

Manufacturers who wanted to include Google Mobile Services are required to comply with Google compatibility guidelines and other requirements, to be approved.

Other manufacturers, choose to offer their own Services instead of using Google Mobile Services. Amazon Android devices (Kindle Fire) runs Amazon appstore and others Amazon apps. Nokia X devices runs Nokia-Microsoft services with their own marketplace.

### Android Bloatware

With manufacturers and carriers are able to add their own apps into their Android based devices, end customers often see additional apps included by either manufacturers or carriers. These software usually are never used and take valuable disk space and device memory.

## Android fragmentation

Android has suffered from "fragmentation",[195] a situation where the variety of Android devices, in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them, makes the task of developing applications that work consistently across the ecosystem harder than rival platforms such as iOS where hardware and software varies less. 

For example, according to data from OpenSignal in July 2013, there were 11,868 models of Android device, numerous different screen sizes and eight Android OS versions simultaneously in use, while the large majority of iOS users have upgraded to the latest iteration of that OS.
